### Hi there! Welcome! :wave:

My name is Eugenia and my career journey began in psychology, but my true passion lies in process, management, and technology. In 2023, I made the leap and studied web application development... and I haven’t looked back since!
Today, **I work as a full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend development at Bymar-Park S.L.** I'm excited to keep growing technically while leveraging the valuable skills I gained in my previous roles.
**Let’s build something great!** :rocket:
